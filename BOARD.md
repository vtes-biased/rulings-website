# Board

What must change. The goal is zero. **Completion is deletion** — no closed state, no archive; git
history is the record. Context lives in [`wiki/`](wiki/index.md), never here: a line that cannot be
completed is documentation, and belongs on a wiki page instead.

**Order is priority**, and priority is decided by these rules, top down:

1. **Blocks someone else** — another person, another repo, another line.
2. **User-visible breakage.**
3. **User-visible feature.**
4. **Internal cleanup.**

Ties break to the smaller line. An item waiting on someone is not a state: it is a dated
follow-up ("chase @lip, 12 Sep"), owned by whoever wrote it.

- **Run the cutover window**: stop v1, `DELETE FROM users`, push the four `vtes-rulings` commits,
  `just release` and deploy. One-way. Done: `rulings.krcg.org` serves v2, a real archon login works,
  and `board/cutover.md` is deleted along with the links to it in `wiki/product.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
  [[board/cutover.md]] steps 5–7
